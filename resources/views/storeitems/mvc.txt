1. Make controller
// php artisan make:controller StoreController (Controls what is output to view)
// It will be in app/Http/Controllers


2. Paste in functions for controlling different operations to views 
3. Paste code from web.php to the appropriate Controller Methods because Controllers will control 
what is in the view 
4. Use the StoreModel to get values from db so they be posted in the Controller 
// $storeitems = Store::orderBy('created_at','desc')->get(); 

5. Hook routes in web.php 
// include StoreController Link 
// use App\Http\Controllers\StoreController;

6. Update the Routes 
// Route::get('/storeitems', [StoreController::class, 'index']);
// The index is the name of the method responsible for views to the user
